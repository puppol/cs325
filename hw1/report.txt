What's the best-case, worst-case, and average-case time complexities of quicksort?
 - Best-case is O(nlogn) and this can be described when each partition is chosen with a middle pivot
 - Worst-case is O(n^2) and this can be described when the pivot is always chosen to be the greatest or lowest value.
 - Average-case is O(nlogn) and this is because on average, the nearest to middle value is chosen on a partition


What are the time complexities for the operations implemented?
 - Sorted
   - Best-case is O(n) because it only touches each element once
   - Worst-case might be O(nlogn) because it has to check each element, and might need to check it again.
 - Search 
   - Best-case is O(n) because I use the quick sort search to verify, and it doesn't have to go through every option
   - Worst-case might be O(nlogn) because it has to check each element, and might need to check it again.
 - Insert
   - Base-case is O(n) because only have to touch up to all elements once.
   - Worst-case might be O(n) but I have a hard time explaining this one/



Debriefing (required!): --------------------------

1. Approximately how many hours did you spend on this assignment?
 - I spent about 9 hours in total on this assignment. 
2. Would you rate it as easy, moderate, or difficult?
 - I thought it was difficult, mainly because I have trouble with runtime complexities, A review of this would be very helpful as 261 didn't dive into how to calculate them for recursion.
3. Did you work on it mostly alone, or mostly with other people?
 - I worked on it mostly alone.
4. How deeply do you feel you understand the material it covers (0%–100%)? 
 - 65%, I would like more help understanding the recursive implantation of insert with python.
5. Any other comments?
 - It was a tough first assignment, but I see its value. Perhaps we had a few more days to work on it and talk about it in class, it would be more reasonable.
