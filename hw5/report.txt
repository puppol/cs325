Q: What's the complexity?
O(n) because it stores the previous reponses, meaning it does not need to recalculate

2.
Qa) O(n^2) as it needs to do two recursive calls through range(n)
Qb) This is called the Catalan number series.

1. Approximately how many hours did you spend on this assignment?
6 hours approx - first question took me a while
2. Would you rate it as easy, moderate, or difficult?
First problem was hard, second and third were easy
3. Did you work on it mostly alone, or mostly with other people?
I worked alone until I worked on the first, then I whiteboarded
4. How deeply do you feel you understand the material it covers (0%-100%)? 
80%
5. Which part(s) of the course you like the most so far?
I liked this assignment, it wasnt too hard but it made me think. I also understand recursion better.
6. Which part(s) of the course you dislike the most so far?
Wish there was more calculating of complexity
