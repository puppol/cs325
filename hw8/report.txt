0. For the following graphs, decide whether they are
    (1) directed or undirected, (2) dense or sparse, and (3) cyclic or acyclic:

    (a) Facebook
        undirected, sparse, cyclic
    (b) Twitter
        directed, sparse, cyclic
    (c) a family
        undirected, dense, cyclic
    (d) V=airports, E=direct_flights
        directed, sparse, cyclic
    (e) a mesh
	directed, sparce, cyclic
    (f) V=courses, E=prerequisites
	directed, sparse, acyclic
    (g) a tree
	undirected, sparse, asyclic
    (h) V=linux_software_packages, E=dependencies
	directed, sparse, asyclic
    (i) DP subproblems for 0-1 knapsack
	directed, sparse, asyclic
    Can you name a very big dense graph?
	V=house, E=road



questions: 
   (a) did you realize that bottom-up implementations of DP use (implicit) topological orderings?
       e.g., what is the topological ordering in your (or my) bottom-up bounded knapsack code?
	
	no
   (b) what about top-down implementations? what order do they use to traverse the graph?
	starting at the top
   (c) does that suggest there is a top-down solution for topological sort as well? 
	yes
