0. There are two methods for building a heap from an unsorted array:
   (1) insert each element into the heap  --- O(nlogn)
   (2) heapify (top-down)                 --- O(n)

   (a) Derive these time complexities.
	1.  As it is a binary tree, it takes log(n) time to insert, and you are inserting n number items, yielding O(nlogn)

	2. Each node checks for a larger child, and swaps itself if it needs to, up tp n number of nodes, yielding O(n)

   (b) Use a long list of random numbers to show the difference in time. (Hint: random.shuffle)
	1,000,000 - heapify -> 0.16089 s
	1,000,000 - heapq.heappush() -> 0.61928 s

	sorted:
	1,000,000 - heapify -> 0.04145 s
	1,000,000 - heapq.heappush() -> 0.39682 s

   (c) What about sorted or reversely-sorted numbers?
	1,000,000 - heapify -> 0.04145 s
	1,000,000 - heapq.heappush() -> 0.39682 s
	reversed had similar times





(a) enumerate all n^2 pairs, sort, and take top n.
	O(n^2)

(b) enumerate all n^2 pairs, but use qselect from hw1.
	O(n^2)

(c) Dijkstra-style best-first, only enumerate O(n) (at most 2n) pairs.
       Hint: you can use Python's heapq module for priority queue.

	O(nlogn)

Q: What is the complexity? Write down the detailed analysis in report.txt.
Best case - O(nlogn)
Average case - O(nlogn)
Worst case - O(nlogn) - Using merge implementation, maintains nlogn worst case


Datastream	
Q: What is your complexity? Write down the detailed analysis in report.txt.
This implementation must be O(nlogn) because it runs n number of times, and pushing to the heap is logn, meaning overall complexity is O(nlogn)

	Difficult
3. Did you work on it mostly alone, or mostly with other people?
   Note you are encouraged to discuss with your classmates, 
   but each students should submit his/her own code.
	50/50
4. How deeply do you feel you understand the material it covers (0%-100%)?

5. Which part(s) of the course you like the most so far?
I like the lectures, and the difficulty of finding the best algorithms
6. Which part(s) of the course you dislike the most so far?
First quiz was rough, and I wish we spent more time on deriving complexity, but what has been done so far has been very helpful
