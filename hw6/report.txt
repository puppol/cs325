1)
   (a) Describe a greedy solution.
	Prioritizing value over the weight, maximizing value but not value for the bag weight.
   (b) Show a counterexample to the greedy solution.
	Given bag size of 3,
	(1,2), (2,3)
	Would yield [1,1] instead of [3,0]
   (c) Define the DP subproblem 
	For each pair, what is the best bag that the pair can be apart of
   (d) Write the recurrence relations
	B = max(value + B, B(n-1)
   (e) Do not forget base cases
	1 <= i <= n, 0 <= w <= W
   (f) Analyze the space and time complexities
	Space: O(n) when mortized 
	Time: O(n) when mortized	



2)
   (a) Describe a greedy solution.
	After sorting by efficiency (v/w), pick from top to bottom and fill the bag
   (b) Show a counterexample to the greedy solution.
	Bag Size = 5
	(4,7,2), (2,3,5), (3,5,2)
	Would yield [0,5] instead of [2,3]	
   (c) Define the DP subproblem 
	Is it better to use the value of the bag plus the value of the pair, or the value of the bag with weight - n and i - 1
   (d) Write the recurrence relations
	B = max(value + B(n-1, weight-w[n]), B(n-1))
   (e) Do not forget base cases
	1 <= i <= n, 0 <= w <= W
   (f) Analyze the space and time complexities
	Space: O(n*w) => O(n)
	Time: O(n*w) => O(n)
